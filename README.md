# Introduction
The identification of the text of spam messages in the claims is very hard and time consuming task and it involves carefully scanning of hundreds of web pages. I am using a SMS data containing over 5000 messages from UCI datasets to built a model that can detect whether the message is spam or ham. In this I will be using basics of Natural Language Processing and Naive Bayes Classifier to build the model
# Objectives
1) To use Natural Language Processing for converting the SMS dataset in a format that the machine learning algorithms can understand.
2) To apply Naive Bayes classification algorithm to build a spam detection filter.
# Steps Involved
1) Getting the data 
2) Exploratory Data Analysis
3) Data Visualization
4) Text Preprocessing
5) Training and testing the model
6) Model Evaluation
# Methodology Used 
1) Natural Language Processing
2) Naive Bayes Classification
# Results Obtained
Precision - 0.97,
Recall - 0.97,
F1-Score - 0.97
